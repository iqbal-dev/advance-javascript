function myfunc() {
    let name = 'md Iqbal hossain';
}
console.log(name);//here name variable is at myfunc function it means name is an myfunc Block. so that name variable is not available outside of the block


console.log(day);//here day is declare so that here output is undefined but value is assigned.because day are in creation phase and that is store in a memory but not assigned a value so that day have undefined value;

var day = 'friday';
